        <p>Hello I’m Akash kumar, a web developer who loves creating websites and applications that are both easy to use and look great. I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, which means I can build everything from interactive, user-friendly, dynamic and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to powerful, efficient back-end systems using Node.js and PHP. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working solutions that meet the needs of users while being easy to maintain and fast to load. My goal is to make sure every project I work on is not only functional but also provides a great experience for anyone who uses it.</p>
        <p>I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more, and I’m always exploring new technologies to stay ahead of the curve. My passion for web development drives me to continually improve my skills and adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Whether I’m building interactive front-end interfaces or designing robust back-end systems, I focus on creating high-quality, scalable solutions that meet the needs of users and businesses alike. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and ensuring that every project is optimized for performance, usability, and speed. Through ongoing learning and hands-on experience, I aim to push the boundaries of what’s possible in web development.</p>

        <h3>Project 1</h3>
        <p>This project is an online shopping website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a clean and responsive design, ensuring it works well on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Users can easily browse through products, view details, and interact with different elements like buttons and hover effects.
		   The HTML is used for the structure, CSS for the styling and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the website. While this version is a static prototype, it demonstrates how an online shopping platform can look and feel, with the potential for further development like adding a shopping cart or checkout system in the future.</p>

        <h3>Project 2</h3>
        <p>This project is a BYJU'S course subscription interface, designed to give users an easy and intuitive way to explore and subscribe to online courses. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the interface provides a seamless browsing experience for users interested in educational content. It includes a clean and responsive design, making it accessible across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
		   Users can view detailed information about various courses, such as course descriptions, pricing, and subscription options. The interface allows users to easily select their desired course and proceed with a subscription, all within a user-friendly layout. HTML is used for the basic structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity, such as dynamic content updates and interactive buttons.
		   While this is a static prototype, the design lays the foundation for a full-fledged course subscription platform that could eventually include features like payment processing and personalized user accounts.</p>
